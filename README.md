Added Classes are not always displaying for me and idk why
update: maybe cuz I hit enter instead of add class
Added an admin page and admin button on the navbar only visible when an Admin
Also made it so if you try to go directly to admin pages through the address bar you get redirected to the index
Started working on the AdminUpdate page, which will let Admin's update user info themselves and upgrade users
